This is my 2013 update on the Ti-Navigation-Controller, originally written by Kevin Whinnery, and
updated by scores of people since. I borrowed heavily from 
Mike at github account, xsaero00 (https://github.com/xsaero00/Ti-Navigation-Controller) for this version; 
Thanks, Mike!

For this, I mainly used module.exports instead of exports (personal preferrance), and added a check in
the NavigationController's open function to prevent the app from crashing when too many windows
would get popped off the stack prematurely (which would happen if you dropped the NavigationController
into an app that had Master-Detail views several layers deep).

As this is an open source project, I may not have time to update this often. 
But please feel free to fork from this project and make your own improvements. 
If you do so, I'd love to hear from you (and so would the rest of my blog readers, as
this would help everyone! :) )
